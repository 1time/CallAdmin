# CallAdmin  
CallAdmin is an multilingual, modular and extendable system to allow inGame reports for HL2-Games and Mods.  

The system is based on 3 parts.  
* An extendable sourcemod-plugin to report players inGame  
* [An Desktopclient](https://github.com/popoklopsi/CallAdmin-Client) to notify admins  when a new report was made  
* An webscript to interact with data from the database for the client
