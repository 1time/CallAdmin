# CallAdmin  
CallAdmin is a multilingual, modular and extendable system to allow inGame reports for HL2-Games and Mods.  

The system is based on 3 parts.  
* A multilingual, extendable sourcemod-plugin to report players inGame  
* [A Desktop Client](https://github.com/popoklopsi/CallAdmin-Client) to notify admins when a new report was made  
* A webscript to interact with data from the database for the client  

Please take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Impact123/CallAdmin/wiki) for for information.

## Notes
* Currently this system is alpha software, use it on your own risk
